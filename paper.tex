A study of \fzero~production at mid-rapidity in proton--proton (pp) and proton--lead (p--Pb) collisions at center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}} = $ 5.02 TeV is conducted with the ALICE detector. The paper illustrates the nuclear modification factor in p--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}=$ 5.02 TeV. It is found that such strong suppression can be originated from ...

In this Letter, we present the measurement of \fzero~nuclear modification factor in p--Pb collisions at $\boldsymbol{\sqrt{{\textit s_{\mathrm{NN}}}}}=5.02$~TeV at mid-rapidity (-0.5~$<\mathrm{y}<$~0). The \fzero~are reconstructed via \fzero~$\rightarrow \pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ decay channel. The results are obtained in the momentum interval 0~$<p_{\mathrm{T}}<$~8 GeV/$c$ and different 4 collisions centrality intervals defined with the Zero Degree Calorimeter. 

The analyzed minimum bias events are pp and p--Pb collisions at $\boldsymbol{\sqrt{{\textit s_{\mathrm{NN}}}}}=5.02$~TeV, which are recorded by the ALICE detector during 2015, 2016, and 2017. The Silicon Pixel Detector (SPD)~\cite{Cali:2008zz} and V0 detectors~\cite{ALICE:2013axi} provide the online minimum bias trigger. The charged particle multiplicity is defined with Zero Degree Calorimeter (ZDC), which detects ``slow'' nucleons at very large $\eta$~\cite{Cortese:2019nnv}. Charged tracks are reconstructed with Time Projection Chamber (TPC)~\cite{Alme:2010ke} and Inner Tracking System (ITS)~\cite{ALICE:2010tia}. The Time of Flight (TOF)~\cite{Jacazio:2018slq} and the TPC are used to select charged pions. The $z$ component of the primary vertex is selected to be within 10 cm from the center of the ALICE detector for a uniform acceptance at mid-rapidity. The systematic uncertainty from the primary vertex selection is tested by narrowing the requirement to 8 cm and the uncertainty is estimated to be negligible. The pileup events are rejected if the longitudinal displacement of their primary vertices is larger than 8 mm and the systematic uncertainty from the pileup rejection is tested by varying the minimal number of track contributors required for reconstruction of pileup event vertices from 5 to 3 and the uncertainty is estimated to be negligible.

Charged tracks are reconstructed using the same criteria explained in~\cite{ALICE:2013wgn}. Reconstructed charged tracks are required to be $p_{\mathrm{T}}>$~0.15 GeV/$c$ and $|\eta|<$~0.8 considering tracking efficiency and TPC acceptance, respectively. The identification of charged pions is done with the TPC and the TOF information. The difference of ionization energy loss between the prediction Bethe-Block parametrization with the pion mass and measured energy is required to be within two standard deviations to identify pions. The difference of flight time between the prediction with the pion mass and measured time is required to be within three standard deviations to identify pions. The systematic uncertainty from tracking is assigned as the value from~\cite{ALICE:2013wgn} and the systematic uncertainty from the particle identification is tested with different requirements on the number of standard deviations by $\pm\,0.5\sigma$ and the uncertainty is estimated to be 3--6\%.

\fzero~resonances are reconstructed via \fzero~$\rightarrow \pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ decay channel. Major combinatory backgrounds can be subtracted by the Like-Sign (LS) pair~\cite{PhysRevD.36.2019}, which is the geometric average of $\pi^{+}\pi^{+}$ and $\pi^{-}\pi^{-}$ pairs. As a results of the LS background subtraction, resonances decaying to $\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ can be seen as each peak on their invariant masses, and $\rho^{0}$ and $\mathrm{f}_{2}$(1270) are found to contribute to the \fzero~region due to their large widths~\cite{ParticleDataGroup:2020ssz}.

The \fzero~raw yield ($N_{\mathrm{raw}}$) is extracted by fitting the invariant mass of $\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ with three relativistic Breit-Wigner functions (rBW)~\cite{ALICE:2015nbw} for \fzero, $\rho^{0}$, and $\mathrm{f}_{2}$(1270) and additional empirical background function~\cite{OPAL:1998enc}. Widths and masses of $\mathrm{f}_{2}$(1270) and $\rho^{0}$ are well defined in~\cite{ParticleDataGroup:2020ssz} so that those are fixed as values provided. The systematic uncertainty from this is tested by shifting the widths and masses as much as three times their measured statistical uncertainty and the uncertainty estimated to be 2\% and 5\% for $\mathrm{f}_{2}$(1270) and $\rho^{0}$, respectively. On the other hand, the width of \fzero~is loosely defined so that \fzero~width is set to free parameter and estimated in the fit procedure. The systematic uncertainty from the fit range is tested with different fit ranges and estimated to be 2\% at the low $p_{\rm{T}}$ and 8\% at the high $p_{\rm{T}}$. The phase space correction~\cite{Rapp:2003ar} is applied to each rBW to consider possible $\pi\pi$ scattering effects. The temperature of the phase space correction is set to 160 MeV~\cite{ALICE:2013wgn} and the systematic uncertainty from the phase space correction is evaluated with different temperatures and estimated to be 5-7\%. The background function is determined with the pre-fit procedure. In the pre-fit procedure, the width of \fzero~is even fixed as a specific value. The systematic uncertainty from the background function is evaluated with different \fzero~widths and estimated to be 8\% at the low $p_{\rm{T}}$ and 3\% at the high $p_{\rm{T}}$.

The \fzero~raw yield ($N_{\mathrm{raw}}$) is evaluated by integrating the \fzero~rBW function and $N_{\mathrm{raw}}$ is normalized to the number of each multiplicity class events and corrected for the vertex quality selection, geometric detector acceptance ($A$) and efficiency ($\varepsilon$), signal loss due to the event selection, and the branching ratio, which is expected to be 46\%~\cite{Stone:2013eaa}. The $A$ and $\varepsilon$ are estimated with the \fzero-injected Monte Carlo simulation, where the detector responses with regard to the acceptance, tracking, and PID are calculated with the Geant4 package. The estimated $A \times \varepsilon$ is estimated to be 30\% at the low $p_{\rm{T}}$ and gradually increasing up to 60\% at the high $p_{\rm{T}}$.

In order to observe possible nuclear effects in p--Pb collisions, measurements in p--Pb collisions are compared with the same measurements in pp collisions with the same collision energy. A comparison of the $p_{\rm{T}}$ differential yield between p--Pb and pp collisions can be defined as the following equation, which is called the nuclear modification factor ($Q_{\mathrm{pPb}}$), as
\begin{eqnarray}
Q_{\mathrm{pPb}} = \dfrac{\mathrm{d}^{2} N_{\mathrm{f}_{0}(980)}^{\mathrm{pPb}} / \mathrm{d} p_{\mathrm{T}} \mathrm{dy} }{ <T_{\mathrm{pPb}}> \mathrm{d}^{2} \sigma_{\mathrm{f}_{0}(980)}^{\mathrm{pp}}/ \mathrm{d} p_{\mathrm{T}} \mathrm{dy} },
\end{eqnarray}
where $<T_{\mathrm{pPb}}>$ and $\sigma_{\mathrm{f}_{0}(980)}^{\mathrm{pp}}$ are the average nuclear overlap from the Glauber model~\cite{Miller:2007ri} and the cross section of \fzero~in pp collisions, respectively. Reported results on $Q_{\mathrm{pPb}}$ in minimum bias events show that particles constituting light-flavour quarks do not show any significant suppression in the high $p_{\rm{T}}>$~3~GeV/$c$~\cite{ALICE:2016dei}.

Figure~\ref{fig:SigExt} shows LS-subtracted invariant mass of $\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ distribution, fitted with the function described above in pp (left) and p--Pb (right) collisions at $\boldsymbol{\sqrt{{\textit s_\mathrm{NN}}}}=5.02$~TeV for the 1.5~$<p_{\rm{T}}<$~2~GeV/$c$. \fzero~signals, even overlapped with contributions from other particles and backgrounds, can be extracted, and The \fzero~raw yield ($N_{\mathrm{raw}}$) is measured by integrating the \fzero~function.

Figure~\ref{fig:pt} shows fully corrected $p_{\rm{T}}$ differential yield down to zero-$p_{\rm{T}}$ in mid-rapidity with different multiplicity classes. A slight hardening with increasing multiplicity can be observed in the low $p_{\rm{T}}$ and disappear in the high $p_{\rm{T}}$.

Figure~\ref{fig:QpPb} shows $Q_{\mathrm{pPb}}$ of \fzero~in p--Pb collisions at $\boldsymbol{\sqrt{{\textit s_\mathrm{NN}}}}=5.02$~TeV in mid-rapidity with different multiplicity classes. $Q_{\mathrm{pPb}}$ of charged hadrons~\cite{ALICE:2014xsp} is gradually increasing with $p_{\rm{T}}$ and unity for $p_{\rm{T}}>$~3~GeV/$c$ for different multiplicity classes. $Q_{\mathrm{pPb}}$ of \fzero, on the other hand, exhibits that the suppression of \fzero~get stronger with increasing multiplicity. In the low multiplicity class (60--80\%), $Q_{\mathrm{pPb}}$ of \fzero~is comparable with $Q_{\mathrm{pPb}}$ of charged hadrons. This agreement gets broken as the multiplicity increases.
