Figure~\ref{fig:pt} shows the $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ spectra of \fzero~in p--Pb collisions at \snn~=~5.02~TeV measured in the range of 0~$<p_{\mathrm{T}}<$~8~GeV/$c$ for different multiplicity classes and non-single diffractive (NSD) events. Each spectrum is scaled with the number denoted in the figure for visibility. The lower panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:pt} shows the ratios of each $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ spectrum to the NSD spectrum. The systematic uncertainties of the ratios are estimated by propagating the multiplicity-uncorrelated uncertainties on the single spectrum. For $p_{\mathrm{T}}<$~4~GeV/$c$, the hardening of the $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ spectrum from low- to high-multiplicity events is clearly seen, while the same shape is visible at high $p_{\mathrm{T}}>$~4~GeV/$c$. Such trends can also be observed for other hadronic species~\cite{Tsallis:1987eu}.

Table~\ref{tab:ymp} shows the integrated yield (d$N$/d$y$) and mean $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ $\left( \left\langle p_{\mathrm{T}} \right\rangle \right)$ of \fzero~for different multiplicity classes in p--Pb collisions at \snn~=~5.02~TeV. The d$N$/d$y$ at midrapidity linearly increases with the multiplicity, while the $\left\langle p_{\mathrm{T}} \right\rangle$ exhibits weak dependence with the charged-particle multiplicity.

The left panel of figure~\ref{fig:f0piAddCSM} shows the double ratios of different particles to charged pion yields as a function of charged-particle multiplicity raised to the power of 1/3 in p--Pb collisions at \snn~=~5.02~TeV. The $\langle \mathrm{d}N/\mathrm{d}\eta \rangle_{|\eta|<0.5}^{1/3}$ signifies a proxy for the dimensionless size of the system~\cite{Liu:2018xae}. We use the V0A to select fractions of the visible cross section and to categorize events based on their multiplicity. The systematic uncertainty of the double ratio is calculated considering only the uncorrelated part of the uncertainty. The pion~\cite{ALICE:2016dei}, \kstar~\cite{ALICE:2016sak}, and $\phi$~\cite{ALICE:2016sak} mesons can be classified according to their lifetimes and to their (anti-) strange quarks. The strangeness enhancement and rescattering effects can be studied by comparing the yield of particles with different characteristics. The ratio of $\phi$ to $\pi$ increases with the multiplicity, which is consistent with the observation of the strangeness enhancement~\cite{ALICE:2016fzo}. On the other hand, the ratio of \kstar~to $\pi$ is flat with increasing multiplicity even if \kstar~contains one strange quark. The flat trend could be explained by two competing effects, the strangeness enhancement and rescattering effects, due to the short lifetime ($\approx$~4.2~fm/$c$) of \kstar~\cite{ParticleDataGroup:2022pth}. The ratio of \fzero~to $\pi$ decreases as the multiplicity increases because of the shorter lifetime of \fzero, suggesting rescattering effects for \fzero. Predictions of the ratio of \fzero~to $\pi$ are shown in lines for different hidden strangeness assumptions for \fzero~by $\gamma_{s}$-Canonical Statistical Model (CSM)~\cite{Vovchenko:2019kes}, which considers system-size-dependent hadrochemistry at vanishing baryon density with local conservation of electric charge, baryon density, and strangeness while allowing for undersaturation of strangeness. Note that $\gamma_{s}$ is the parameter for the undersaturation of strangeness derived from measured particle yields. The CSM hypothesis with two hidden strange quarks predicts an increase in the ratio, contrary to what is observed experimentally. Moreover, the CSM with zero hidden strangeness predicts a \fzero~to $\pi$ ratio that decreases much less than what is measured. Such a difference could be attributed to no rescattering effects in the CSM. The prediction of the CSM for the ratio of $\phi$ to $\pi$ nicely reproduces the increasing trend of measured data with the increasing multiplicity, where the hidden strangeness of $\phi$ is two. However, the CSM overestimates the ratio of \kstar~to $\pi$ because the modification of \kstar~yields due to rescattering effects is not implemented in the CSM.

The right panel of figure~\ref{fig:f0piAddCSM} shows the double ratio of \fzero~to \kstar~yields as a function of charged-particle multiplicity elevated to 1/3 in p--Pb collisions at \snn~=~5.02~TeV and predictions from the CSM with different hidden strangeness assumptions. The lifetimes of \fzero~and \kstar~are estimated to be comparable, indicating that rescattering effects are not expected to be much different. Hence, the ratio is expected to be weakly affected by rescattering effects. The ratio decreases with increasing multiplicity that is qualitatively described with the zero-hidden-strangeness assumption and can be explained by the strangeness enhancement of the \kstar~yield. The CSM prediction with the two-hidden-strangeness assumptions is mildly increasing as the multiplicity increases, a trend that is opposite to the experimental result as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:f0piAddCSM}. Therefore, the decreasing trend of the ratio of \fzero~to \kstar~can suggest no effective strangeness enhancement for the \fzero.

Figure~\ref{fig:f0piPt} shows the $p_{\mathrm{T}}$-differential particle yield ratio of \fzero~to $\pi$ in high-multiplicity (HM, 0--20\%) and low-multiplicity (LM, 60--100\%) p--Pb collisions at \snn~=~5.02~TeV. The ratios are consistent within one sigma in $p_{\mathrm{T}}>$~4~GeV/$c$, while the double ratio of HM to LM is suppressed at a lower $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ as shown in the lower panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:f0piPt}. In the double ratio, the correlated uncertainties across multiplicity classes cancel. The $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ dependence of the double ratio indicates that the suppression of the integrated yield is mainly occurring at low $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ values ($p_{\mathrm{T}}<$~4~GeV/$c$), which shows the same $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ dependence as the suppression of the \kstar$\rm{}/K$~\cite{ALICE:2019etb}.

	\label{fig:f0KsPt}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:f0KsPt} shows the $p_{\mathrm{T}}$-differential particle yield ratio of \fzero~to \kstar~in HM and LM p--Pb collisions at \snn~=~5.02~TeV. The ratio from HM events is lower than that of LM events in the entire $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ range, differently from what is observed for \kstar$\rm{}/K$ or \fzero/$\pi$. The suppression of the ratio of HM events at high $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ indicates that other effects, beyond rescattering effects, are present. For instance, the enhancement of \kstar~yield due to the strangeness enhancement can explain the suppression over the entire $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ range with the assumption of no strangeness enhancement for \fzero. The absence of the strangeness enhancement is inferred as no strange quarks in \fzero. As a result, the decreasing trend of the ratio in higher multiplicity events suggests no strange quark in \fzero.

Open boxes around $p_{\rm{T}}$~=~0.5~GeV/$c$ represent the binary collision scaling uncertainties. The $Q_{\rm{pPb}}$ of charged hadrons~\cite{ALICE:2014xsp} are reported for comparison. }

\end{figure}

The $p_{\rm{T}}$-differential invariant yield of \fzero~in p--Pb collisions can be compared to the one in pp collisions at the same center-of-mass energy by computing the nuclear modification factor $Q_{\mbox{pPb}}$, defined as 
\begin{eqnarray}
Q_{\mbox{pPb}} = \dfrac{\mathrm{d}^{2} N_{\mathrm{f}_{0}(980)}^{\mathrm{pPb}} / \mathrm{d} p_{\mathrm{T}} \mathrm{dy} }{ \left\langle T_{\mathrm{pPb}} \right\rangle \mathrm{d}^{2} \sigma_{\mathrm{f}_{0}(980)}^{\mathrm{pp}}/ \mathrm{d} p_{\mathrm{T}} \mathrm{dy} },
\end{eqnarray}
where $\left\langle T_{\mathrm{pPb}} \right\rangle$ and $\sigma_{\mathrm{f}_{0}(980)}^{\mathrm{pp}}$ are extracted using an event selection based on the
ZN to minimize the possible biases according to what reported in~\cite{ALICE:2014xsp} and the cross section for the production of \fzero~in pp collisions measured and reported in~\cite{ALICE:2022qnb}, respectively. Note that the B.R. is canceled out in the measurement of the $Q_{\mbox{pPb}}$ as the same value is used in pp and p--Pb collisions.

Figure~\ref{fig:QpPb} shows the $Q_{\mbox{pPb}}$ of \fzero~in p--Pb collisions at \snn~=~5.02~TeV in different multiplicity classes. The Pb-remnant side neutron calorimeter, labeled ZNA, is used to select centrality intervals to calculate the $Q_{\mathrm{pPb}}$. The systematic uncertainties are calculated with the assumption that there is no correlated uncertainty between the yield in pp and p--Pb collisions. The \fzero~is getting more suppressed than charged hadrons~\cite{ALICE:2014xsp} for $p_{\mathrm{T}}<$~4~GeV/$c$ with increasing multiplicity. As $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ increases, \fzero~$Q_{\rm{pPb}}$ values become compatible with those for charged particles, reaching unity. The dependencies of the nuclear modification factor on the multiplicity and $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ are the same as observed in Fig.~\ref{fig:f0piPt}, indicating that rescattering effects largely contribute to the suppression of the \fzero~yield. In addition, the $Q_{\rm{pPb}}$ does not exhibit the Cronin-like enhancement~\cite{Cronin:1974zm} at the intermediate $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ in HM events. This is a consistent trend of conventional mesons~\cite{ALICE:2016dei}. The absence of the Cronin-like enhancement for \fzero~might suggests that the number of constituent quarks of \fzero~is smaller than three.
