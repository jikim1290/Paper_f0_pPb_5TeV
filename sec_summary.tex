\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:summary}

The multiplicity dependent \fzero~production in p--Pb collisions at \snn~=~5.02~TeV is presented. \fzero~is reconstructed via the \fzero~$\rightarrow\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ decay channel in midrapidity (-0.5~$<\mathrm{y}<$~0) in the transverse momentum region of $0<p_{\mathrm{T}}<8$~GeV/$c$.
The transverse momentum ($p_{\mathrm{T}}$) spectra of \fzero~ particles show an increasing trend of the yield and the mean $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ for higher multiplicity events. The particle yield ratio of \fzero~to $\pi$ is decreasing with the multiplicity and the suppression exists only at low $p_{\mathrm{T}}<$~4~GeV/$c$, indicating that the rescattering effects exist for \fzero~particles. The Canonical Statistical Model (CSM) overestimates the \fzero/$\pi$ and it does not describe the decreasing trend because the CSM does not consider rescattering effects. The particle yield ratio of \fzero~to $\rm{}K^{*0}$ also decreases with the increasing multiplicity. The suppression exists in the entire $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ range, which is a different $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ dependency from rescattering effects. The CSM qualitatively estimates the decreasing trend for \fzero/$\rm{}K^{*0}$ with the assumption of no hidden strangeness for \fzero, while it overestimates the \fzero/$\rm{}K^{*0}$ with the assumption of the two hidden strangeness. The result implies that $\rm{}K^{*0}$ is relatively enhanced compared with \fzero~due to the strangeness enhancement. Furthermore, the multiplicity-dependent nuclear modification factor for \fzero~exhibits a strong suppression at a low $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ and the suppression depends on the multiplicity class, which can be explained by the rescattering effects. Additionally, no Cronin peak is observed from the nuclear modification factor, even in high-multiplicity events. This suggests the number of constituent quarks of the \fzero~particle is smaller than three.
