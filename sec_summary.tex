\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:summary}

The multiplicity-dependent \fzero~production in p--Pb collisions at \snn~=~5.02~TeV is presented. The \fzero~is reconstructed via the \fzero~$\rightarrow\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ decay channel in midrapidity ($-0.5<y<0$) in a transverse momentum region of $0<p_{\mathrm{T}}<8$~GeV/$c$. The $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ spectra of \fzero~particles show an increasing trend of the yield and the mean $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ for higher multiplicity events. The particle yield ratio of \fzero~to $\pi$ is decreasing with increasing multiplicities, and the clear suppression of the \fzero~to $\pi$ ratio is observed only for $p_{\mathrm{T}}<$~4~GeV/$c$, indicating that rescattering effects for \fzero~particles exist. The CSM overestimates the \fzero/$\pi$, and it does not describe the decreasing trend because the CSM does not consider rescattering effects. The particle yield ratio of \fzero~to \kstar~also decreases with increasing multiplicities. The suppression of the \fzero~to \kstar~ratio is observed in the entire $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ region, showing a different $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ dependency relative to the one expected from a rescattering scenario. The CSM qualitatively estimates the decreasing trend for \fzero/\kstar~with the assumption of no hidden strangeness for \fzero, while it overestimates the \fzero/\kstar~with the assumption of two strange quarks. The result indicates that \kstar~is relatively enhanced compared with \fzero~due to the strangeness enhancement. Furthermore, the multiplicity-dependent nuclear modification factor ($Q_{\mathrm{pPb}}$) for \fzero~exhibits a strong suppression at a low $p_{\mathrm{T}}$, and the suppression depends on the multiplicity class, which can be explained by the rescattering effects. Additionally, no Cronin-like enhancement is observed from the $Q_{\mathrm{pPb}}$, even in high-multiplicity events. The absence of the Cronin-like enhancement suggests that the number of constituent quarks of the \fzero~particle is smaller than three. The abnormal suppression in terms of multiplicity and transverse momentum relative to other particles helps us improve our understanding of the nature of the internal structure of \fzero~as well as the late hadronic phase in pâ€“Pb collisions.
